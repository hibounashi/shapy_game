# Shapy Bits : the Geometric Shapes Learning Game

this Python project, developed as part of my 3 year at ESTIN (1CS), implements an interactive game to help users learn about geometric shapes. It utilizes an expert system based on the AIMA (Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach) library to provide guidance and quizzes to users.
